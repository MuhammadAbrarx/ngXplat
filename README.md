This project written in Angular 2 can be used to write,

a) Web based applications,

b) Cordova applications for iOS, Android, Windows

c) Electron apps targeting Mac, Windows and Linux

.. and it can do so with 100% code reuse. Just write the app once and run everywhere (yeah really!)

Instructions: git clone, npm install, npm start.

todo: Need to clean up bundling and dist.
